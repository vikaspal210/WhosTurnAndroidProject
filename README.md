Idea behind the app...

The basic idea behind the app is to switch turns.

It is designed to handle scenarios when we need to keep account of the turns. For example, imagine there are two roommates who live on second floor. They get their food through tiffin service.

The delivery meal delivers the food at ground floor. Now, one of them has to go at the ground floor and bring the tiffins. They do this turn-by-turn. So, the one who brought the tiffin one time would not go the next time.

The purpose of the app here, is to provide a switch. The detailed working would be as follows.

- The app would store, whose turn it is.
- The roommate who is going to get the tiffin, would press the switch while on the way.
- The app, then, would send a request to other roommate to confirm the switching of the turn and store in the app.

This is one example. SWITCH can be used in any situation that demands switching relationship, especially, between siblings who keep fighting over the turns.
